# RestoRoom






> **Early WIP** — A community-driven reimplementation of the Rec Room servers, keeping Rec Room alive past June 1st, 2026.

## What is this?

Rec Room has shut down on **June 1st, 2026**. RestoRoom is an open-source effort to reverse engineer and reimplement the Rec Room server infrastructure so the community can keep playing after the lights go out.

This is a preservation project, built by fans, for fans.

---

## ⚠️ Status

**This project is in very early development.** Nothing is playable yet. We're currently in the research and reverse engineering phase.

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| Network protocol research | 🔄 In progress — [20 subdomains discovered](docs/api/subdomains.md) |
| Account / auth server | ❌ Not started |
| Room server | ❌ Not started |
| Photon relay | ❌ Not started |
| Client patching / redirect | ❌ Not started |

## How it works (planned)

Rec Room's backend consists of several systems we need to reimplement:

- **REST API** — account management, friends, inventory, room listings
- **Photon networking** — real-time multiplayer via Photon SDK
- **Client redirect** — patching the client to point at our servers instead of official ones

Our approach:
1. Sniff and document traffic between the Rec Room client and official servers
2. Reimplement each backend service
3. Patch or proxy the client to use our servers

The official servers are going away. The community doesn't have to.
